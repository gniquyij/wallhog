# Hog the wall

'Across the Great Wall, we can reach every corner of the world. '

It is said to be a sentence in an email sent from China in 1987 which sounds interesting in 2020. 
For a relatively okay connection to the world - here connection refers to web search, I've been collecting and using some sites which are not blocked by the wall meanwhile provide not that man-made results.
But for some reasons like [DNS](https://vjyq.github.io/wcrXic/gist-github-com/gist-github-com), the distance to the server, etc., connection is always a problem. 
Take 5+ minutes to wait for a response which might be timeout? In this situation, I used to switch to another one on the list to see if that would work. 

You might notice, let us say for a single search, I need 5 minutes * times I tried, which is still time consuming. 
Why not trigger them at the same time? I thought. Here comes [wallhog](https://github.com/vjyq/wallhog.git).
